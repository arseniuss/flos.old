<em>flos</em> operating system</h1>

<p><em>flos</em> is Plan9, Unix and Xok/Aegis inspired hobby operating system. This 
project haven't its specification but just ideas which may be useful in future 
versions. This repository contains implementation of kernel and 
some libraries.
I hope that I won't abandon this project like I did with old one (my bad).</p>
