# _flos_ operating system #

_flos_ is Plan9, Unix and Xok/Aegis inspired hobby operating system. This
project haven't its specification but just ideas which may be useful in future
versions. This repository contains implementation of kernel and
some libraries.
I hope that I won't abandon this project like I did with old one (my bad).
